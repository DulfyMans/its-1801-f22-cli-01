# Practice commands for Linux shell

# Shell is a program that can be used to run commands
# Usually called system commands

#~/its-1801-f22-cli-01$ is called a prompt

# ~ represents the home directory
# / is a separator for directories and or files
# its-1801-f22-cli-01 is another directory

# ls is for listing files & directories in the current directory

# ls - l is for long list format
# The first letter indicates if it is a directory (d) or a file (-)

# ls -al is for long format and showing hidden files

# Hidden files have names that start with a dot (.)

# cd is for changing directories (notice that the prompt also reflects the change)

# To go up one directory:
# cd ..

# Shells usually have autocomplete using the tab key

# pwd (present working directory) can show the full path to the directory you are currently in

# cat command (catalog)
# To show the contents of a text file (file that has characters that are printable on the screen)
